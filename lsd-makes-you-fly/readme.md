## Can LSD Make You Fly?

>  __A Hypothetical exploration of Bayesian and Frequentist Stats__

Suppose you're a statistician whose taken acid for the first time, roughly 3 hours ago. You're standing on a balcony admiring the beautiful colors and sights when it hits you:

"I think I can fly..."

Being a good statistician -- you are skeptical. You've never flown before, but you've also never done acid before. Perhaps we should design some experiments to test whether or not people can fly while using acid before we leap off of our own balcony!

### Lets Design An Experiment!

First we're going to make some hypotheses. Our null hypothesis is that LSD does not give anyone the ability to fly at all. But, maybe because we're high on acid, we're willing to entertain the alternative hypotheses that maybe LSD actually does give you the ability to fly.

In a frequentist world to test this hypothesis we're going to have to collect some data. Lets say we design an experiment where a group of `n` test subjects are given LSD. Three hours later all of them will jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at the same moment (so that no individual can bias another by flying or not flying). Then we'll observe the number that fly.

### Before We Gather The Data...

We need to decide what standard of proof we're going to hold ourselves to. How many people do we need to dope up and push off a bridge? How many of them would need to fly for us to conclude that LSD *might* give you the power of flight.
